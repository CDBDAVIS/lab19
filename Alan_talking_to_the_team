Hello everyone!
I tried to find you on fb based on your names on github but was unsuccessful.
I do not want to spend more time on this lab, so I just pulled from the
distributed code to have a personal folder, and I submitted from it.
Just wanted to let you know! I would have been happy to do it for everyone,
but I had no idea if you still wanted to work on it, so I did not want to
scratch all of our work. And again I was not sure how to contact you haha
I hope you'll get to read this.
Cheers!
(My name is Alan Le Goallec, if you search for me on fb)
